- **Query Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface to search logs based on different criteria.
- **Log Display**: Displays queried logs in a tabular format.

## Technologies Used
- **Elasticsearch**: Used as the primary database for log storage and querying.
- **React.js**: Frontend framework used for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: Backend server handling API requests and Elasticsearch interactions.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- Elasticsearch set up and running locally or remotely
